INSECTINATOR 
Programmed by Ben Klein


A simple 20 questions guessing game geared towards insects. 
Think of a general insect type like an ant, spider, bee, or centipede. 
30 different types of bugs can be succesfully guessed.


The file "insects.txt" as well as the folders "bugs" and "bug attributes" must be in the same directory 
as insectinator.py in order for it to work.
